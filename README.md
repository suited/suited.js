## Suited

The awesome framework which allows you to have both your presentation and the accompaning presentation in one convenient place.

The page can be viewed as normal but through a shortcut or URL be placed in presentation mode.

In presentation mode all 'section' elements marked with the atribute 'data-slide' as a slide that can be navigated through as in a presentation.

The slides will be treated as individual views that fill the screen.

Initial support for HTML in slides, with other language support such as markdown or reStructuredText
