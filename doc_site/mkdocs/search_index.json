You can write a document once and change what is displayed and how by changing the document mode. As an example, you can take a blog post and turn it into a presentation using the 'deck' mode.\n\n\nBut why?\n\n\nSometimes you write a report on a piece of work only to hear they want you to present the report on Monday. Sometimes you do a cool brown bag presentation and people ask for the slides, but what good are the slides on their own really? Have you ever wished the lecturer had more detail on their slides?  \n\n\nUsing Suited you can create one document to fill all those roles by simply marking out the parts of the document you want to highlight.\n\n\nWe like to think of it as the inverse of a normal presentation slide deck. Instead of slides with embedded speaker notes, you have a document and embedded the slides.",
